**SwiftBot**

SwiftBot is a compact and agile robot project that can navigate obstacles effortlessly while following lines efficiently. The intelligent design allows you to move quickly and easily over difficult terrain, making it perfect for various uses.

**Introduction **

SwiftBot is a small robotic project that demonstrates how to integrate obstacle avoidance and line-following functionalities. It utilizes infrared (IR) sensors for line following and an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection. The robot's smart control logic ensures it can swiftly move through challenging environments.

**Features **

- Obstacle avoidance: SwiftBot can detect and navigate around obstacles in its path.
- Line following: The robot can accurately follow lines using infrared sensors.
- Compact design: SwiftBot's compact size allows it to navigate tight spaces.
- Agile movement: Its design allows for quick and agile movements.
- Easy to use: The project provides a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

**Hardware**

- Arduino board
- Infrared (IR) sensors (2x) for line following
- Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection
- Motor driver to control the motors
- Wheels and motors for movement
- Chassis and frame for the robot

**Software**

- Arduino IDE
- NewPing library for ultrasonic sensor
- (Any other libraries or dependencies required)

**Getting Started** 


1. Use  the repository: `github.com/aroramoksh11`
2. Connect the hardware components following the circuit diagram in the `Hardware` section.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
4. Power on your SwiftBot and watch it navigate obstacles and follow lines.

## Usage

- Place SwiftBot on a track or path with lines for line following.
- Watch SwiftBot as it autonomously follows the lines.
- Place obstacles in its path to see how it smartly avoids them.
